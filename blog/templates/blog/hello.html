                    Why do i even need a website? Well, i wanted to practice Django and find a way to get familiar with Bootstrap 4, plus I had a bunch of photos around and i already had a GCP....
                    So, why not? By the way, the page itself (actually, a Django web app in Python 3.7 with a bit of JavaScript here and there) is also available <a href="https://github.com/ayy-em/somethingreally.fun">on Github</a>
