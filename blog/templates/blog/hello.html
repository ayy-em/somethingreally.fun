                    The question you probably have: why do i even need a website? Well, i wanted to practice Django and
                    find a way to get familiar with Bootstrap 4, plus I had a bunch of photos around and i already had a GCP....
                    So, why not? By the way, the page itself (actually, a Django web app in Python 3.7 with a bit of
                    JavaScript here and there) is also available <a href="https://github.com/ayy-em/somethingreally.fun">on Github</a>
                    if you want to be judgemental or looking to contribute.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of exciting stuff about Amsterdam can be found in the <a href="/amsterdam">Amsterdam
                        section</a> of the website.</li>
                    <li>If you're looking to get into coding, <a href="/code">take a look at Code Central.</a> I'm
                        working on a series of kickass tutorials for beginners at the moment.</li>
                    <li>And then there's <a href="/blog">the Blog Territory</a> as well, with a lot of guest writers,
                        photos, interviews and other fun stuff. You can also write something for this section.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, you can always <a href="/contact">contact me,</a> as I assume that's why you came here
                        in the first place.</li>
                </ul>
