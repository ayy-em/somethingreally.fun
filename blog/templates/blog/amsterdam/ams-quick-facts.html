            Must know facts about Amsterdam
        </h1>
        <p class="my-4">
            Definitely handy to know these prior to traveling here. They also can be entertaining enough to keep you from
            going to sleep for five more minutes, which you would totally regret the next morning. Anyway, let's get
            this started! You can click the facts to learn more. Well, you should, but I did not test it on any browsers
            other than Chrome, so good luck.

                  is even higher in the capital and the Dutch version of English even has a name - Dunglish (or

                  The law still defines these as controlled substances. The legal framework is actually filled with loopholes:
                  for example, there are licenses for growing and selling weed, but no license for transportation. Which
                  makes the situation complicated for the delivery drivers - possession of huge amounts is really illegal!
                  However, non-enforcement and tolerance policies are in place. Which means that the worst that could happen
                  would be having a policeman tell you to put your joint away. Just make sure to not be a dick by smoking in a public place.

                  In 1664 New Amsterdam shifted to English control and that's where it all went downhill.
