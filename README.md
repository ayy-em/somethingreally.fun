# SomethingReally.fun 
### <i>Django webapp</i>

A new web app for my blog (still work in progress). Backend in Python 3.7 using Django 3.0.1 & MySQL db, frontend using CSS3 with Bootstrap 4.3.1. Features Telegram post fetching thru its open API, and a showcase of quite some chatbots of mine (which are actually webhooked to an AWS Lambda functions).

Deployed as a webapp on Google App Engine (cause screw AWS), with custom domain mappings to https://somethingreally.fun (if the DNS settings are fine).

Always up for a fork - suggest your stuff!
